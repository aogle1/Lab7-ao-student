 Answer the following questions:
 
What is the purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.printReverse?
 - The purpose of these auxiliary methods is to perform the recursion.
Why do these methods need to have arguments, and how does the argument change from one recursive call to the next?
 - You need arguments as you are operating on these arguments in each recursive call. 
What are the time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as ReverseLines.printReverse?
 - O(n).
Which of these methods can be implemented using while loops?
 - All of them can be implemented using while loops.
